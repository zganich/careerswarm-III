## Environment Guide — Which Claude Tool to Use

James works across three Claude environments. Each has a distinct role:

### Claude Code (terminal / VS Code)
**Use for:** All code work. TypeScript fixes, new API routes, React components, Supabase migrations, git commits, Vercel deploys, npm installs, debugging.
**Has:** Full repo access, bash, git, npm, tsc, Vercel CLI.
**Does NOT have:** MCP connections, Cowork skills, document generation.
**How to start:** `cd` into the repo root, run `claude`. CLAUDE.md is auto-loaded.

### Cowork (Claude desktop app) — PRIMARY ENVIRONMENT
**Use for:** Everything. Code edits, database ops, browser testing, documents, grants, strategy, MCP tasks, git push. This is the single control center.
**Has:** Workspace folder, MCP connections (Vercel, Gmail, Google Calendar, Notion), skills (docx, pptx, pdf, xlsx), Supabase API access, GitHub push via token, Claude in Chrome for browser testing.
**CLI credentials available in this session:**
- Supabase personal access token: stored, use Management API at `https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/grcnfkxmmrboavlbqnqs/database/query`
- Supabase service role key: available via API key endpoint (fetch fresh each session)
- GitHub token: set in git remote URL — `git push origin main` works directly from Cowork
**Key skills to invoke:** `docx` / `pptx` / `pdf` for document output.
**Does NOT have:** `npm install`, `tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript compile check) — for these only, use Claude Code.
**How to start:** Open Claude desktop app, select Cowork. CLAUDE.md is loaded via workspace folder.

### Claude Chat (claude.ai — web or mobile)
**Use for:** Quick strategic questions, brainstorming, reviewing a pasted document, thinking through decisions, or any session where you don't have desktop access.
**Has:** Conversation, file uploads (paste or attach), web search.
**Does NOT have:** Workspace folder access, MCP connections, skills, or persistent project context.
**How to use without losing context:**
1. Open claude.ai in browser or the Claude mobile app.
2. Start your message with this block (copy/paste from here):

```
PROJECT CONTEXT — CareerSwarm III
Live URL: https://careerswarm.com | Repo: zganich/careerswarm-III
Stack: Next.js 14 + Supabase + Anthropic SDK + Tailwind + Radix UI
Vercel: Hobby plan (10s function timeout)
[Paste the Current State section below, then ask your question]
```

3. Copy the "Current State" section from this file and paste it after the block above.
4. Ask your question. Claude chat will have enough context to give useful answers.

**For code reviews on mobile:** Copy the relevant file contents directly into the chat. Claude chat can review, suggest fixes, and explain — you then implement in Claude Code when back at your desk.

---

## Handoff Protocol — Switching Environments

When switching from one environment to another mid-task:
1. In the current environment, note what was just completed and what is next.
2. Update the "Current State" section of this file (Cowork and Claude Code can both write here).
3. In the new environment, read this file top to bottom before touching anything.

## Rules — Follow Every Time

### Before starting any task
1. Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` to understand current state
2. Read this file (CLAUDE.md) top to bottom
3. If touching any `.ts` or `.tsx` file, run `tsc --noEmit` first to know the baseline error count

### While working
4. Never commit directly to `main` without running `tsc --noEmit` and confirming 0 errors
5. Never use `em dashes (—)` in any output, resume, or cover letter content
6. Never hallucinate metrics — all achievement numbers must come from the user's Career DNA
7. Always check if a change in one file affects types, consuming components, or API routes before committing
8. Keep API routes under Vercel's 10s Hobby limit — use `MODELS.generation` (Sonnet), not `MODELS.synthesis` (Opus), unless on Pro

### After every task
9. Run `tsc --noEmit` — must be 0 errors before committing
10. `git add` only the files changed for that task (never `git add -A` blindly)
11. Commit with a clear message describing what changed and why
12. `git push origin main`
13. Update the "Current State" section of this file and commit the update
14. Confirm the Vercel build triggered and passed before marking task complete
15. **End-of-session ritual:** Before closing, ask: "Was anything learned, decided, corrected, or preferred in this session that future Claude sessions should know?" If yes, add it to the Decisions Log or Learnings section below. This is how the file compounds — every session should leave it slightly smarter than it was.

### Git workflow
- Branch: always work on `main` for this project (single dev, no PRs needed until Phase 2+)
- Commit style: `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:` prefixes
- Never force push, never skip hooks

## Decisions Log

Architectural and strategic decisions with the reasoning behind them. Do not reverse these without understanding the original reason first. If a decision needs to change, update this log with why.

| Decision | What was chosen | Why — do not revert without reading this |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| PDF parsing library | `unpdf` v1 | `pdf-parse` crashes on Vercel serverless/edge functions due to native binary dependencies. `unpdf` is a serverless-first PDF.js wrapper with zero native deps. Replaced in Phase 1. |
| AI model routing | Sonnet for generation, Haiku for scoring/extraction | Hobby plan has a 10s function timeout. Opus times out. Haiku handles simple extraction fast and cheap. Never use Opus on Hobby. Constants live in `lib/claude.ts` as `MODELS.generation` and `MODELS.fast`. |
| Git branching | Single `main` branch | Single developer, no PRs needed until a technical co-founder joins. Simplifies the workflow. Revisit at Phase 4 when team hiring starts. |
| Database | Supabase | Built-in auth, RLS, storage, and real-time. Reduces external service count vs. PlanetScale + Auth0 + S3. All tables scoped to `auth.uid() = user_id` via RLS. |
| Career DNA as master database | Master Profile, not static resume | Every generated resume is a derived output from the Master Profile. The Profile never shrinks when tailoring — it only grows. This is the core product moat. Do not redesign this pattern. |
| Persona hardcoding | Scheduled for Sprint 0 refactor | Codebase currently has hardcoded partnerships/BD persona in 7 locations (`onboarding/page.tsx`, `lib/prompts/parse-resume.ts`, `lib/prompts/extract-skills.ts`, `lib/prompts/score-opportunity.ts`, `app/page.tsx`, and others). Fix is `lib/role-taxonomy.ts` as single source of truth with parameterized prompts. Do NOT add more hardcoded partnerships references anywhere. |
| /roast page auth | Unprotected route | Resume Roast is the top-of-funnel acquisition tool — no account required. Do not add `/roast` to the protected paths in `middleware.ts`. Guest sessions use `session_token` in localStorage and link to account post-signup. |
| Stripe status | Wired but not live | Stripe checkout, webhooks, and portal are built. Env vars (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO`) are NOT yet set in Vercel. Webhook is NOT yet registered in Stripe dashboard. Do not assume Stripe is functional until both are confirmed. |
| Humanization layer | Shared prompt constant, not post-processing | Humanization rules belong at the end of each prompt in `lib/prompts/` (cover-letter, outreach, resume summary section) as a shared `HUMANIZATION_RULES` constant — not as a separate API call. One import, all agents inherit the change. |
| Document generation (Cowork) | JS generator scripts + docx npm | Pattern: write a Node.js generator script in `/sessions/loving-cool-wright/careerswarm-spec/`, run with `node`, copy output `.docx`/`.pptx` to workspace folder. The local npm project at that path has `docx` and `pptxgenjs` installed. |

## Learnings

Preferences, repeated corrections, and patterns James has established. Every Claude session in every environment should read this before starting work. Add to this list whenever a preference is stated or a mistake is corrected.

**Writing & tone**
- James prefers prose over bullet points in proposals, strategy documents, and any long-form writing. Use bullets only when the content is genuinely list-like (e.g., a feature comparison table, a checklist).
- Never use em dashes (—) in any generated content — resumes, cover letters, proposals, or code comments. Use a comma, a period, or restructure the sentence.
- Never use the words "genuinely," "straightforward," or "honestly" in any output.
- IBM proposal and founder-facing documents use first-person voice for narrative sections (Problem Statement, Team, Closing). Keep this consistent across all versions.
- When writing founder narrative, lead with the human story before the statistics. The story earns the numbers; the numbers don't earn the story.
- Always run the `humanize` skill on cover letters, outreach copy, and proposal prose before finalizing (Cowork only — invoke via skill tool).

**Code & architecture**
- Never suggest reverting a decision that is documented in the Decisions Log without first reading the reason and flagging the conflict explicitly.
- `maxDuration = 90` in `parse-resume/route.ts` only works on Vercel Pro. On Hobby, the limit is 10s. Do not increase timeouts — optimize for speed or queue the work instead.
- Always check `lib/types.ts` before adding new fields to any component or API route. Type changes have downstream effects across consuming components and routes.
- When adding a new Supabase table or column, write the migration SQL in `supabase/migrations/` with a timestamped filename. Never alter the schema directly in the Supabase dashboard without a corresponding migration file.

**Workflow**
- At the end of every session (Claude Code or Cowork), update the Current State section and ask the end-of-session ritual question (Rule 15). This is not optional — it is how context persists.
- When switching environments mid-task, note what was just completed and what is next before closing. The next environment reads this file first.
- James works across three environments: Claude Code (code), Cowork (documents + MCP), Claude Chat (mobile/strategic). See Environment Guide at the top of this file for task routing.

**Business context**
- CareerSwarm is pre-revenue but live. The product works. The blockers to revenue are Stripe env vars (not set) and top-of-funnel (Resume Roast not built yet).
- Entity formation (Utah LLC) is in progress. Grant applications (IBM Impact Accelerator deadline March 25 2026, Microsoft for Startups, Anthropic startup credits) are the immediate funding priority.
- James is both the founder and the target user — a partnerships/BD executive who lived the job search problem firsthand. This is not a pivot or a business school exercise. The founder story belongs in all external-facing materials.
- Never let grant or investor materials claim "paying subscribers" or "paying customers" until Stripe is confirmed live. This is a material misrepresentation risk.

**Workflow (updated March 21 2026)**
- Primary email for CareerSwarm business is james@careerswarm.com — use this in all documents, proposals, and external-facing materials. jknight3@gmail.com is the Gmail MCP connected account — use it for inbox searches but not as the business contact email.
- Claude Projects system is now set up: CLAUDE-PROJECT-BRIEF.md is the condensed knowledge file for Claude Projects, CLAUDE.md is the full living document. Both live in the workspace. Project brief should be added to the CareerSwarm III Claude Project as a knowledge file.
- Scheduled tasks are live: morning briefing fires weekdays at 8am, IBM deadline alert fires March 24 at 8am. Check the Scheduled sidebar to manage them. Run morning briefing once manually to pre-approve tool access.
- Power user infrastructure is documented in POWER-USER-PLAYBOOK.md — 7 layers covering context, automation, MCPs, conversation patterns, parallel agents, memory management, and skills.
- Stale draft docs should be deleted once a POLISHED version exists. Only keep the submission-ready version of each document.
- One topic per conversation is the discipline that keeps Claude performing well. Start new conversations frequently; the project knowledge file means context never gets lost.

**Workflow (updated March 20 2026)**
- James wants Claude to decide top priorities, not present options. Be direct. Lead with the most important thing.
- James is not technical. Explain git/code concepts in plain English. GITHUB-REFERENCE.md in workspace root is the reference guide.
- Cowork is now the PRIMARY environment. It can push to git, run Supabase queries, and do browser testing. Claude Code is only needed for `npm install` and `tsc --noEmit`.
- GitHub token is wired into git remote — Cowork can run `git push origin main` directly. No more PR dance.
- Supabase Management API works from Cowork bash: POST to `https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/grcnfkxmmrboavlbqnqs/database/query` with the personal access token.
- Supabase service role key can be fetched fresh via `https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/grcnfkxmmrboavlbqnqs/api-keys` — use for auth admin operations (creating users, etc).
- Test user exists: `tester@careerswarm.com` / `TestUser2026!` — use for browser/API testing without touching James's account.
- Claude in Chrome browser automation can READ pages on careerswarm.com reliably but CANNOT execute JavaScript or click on pages when the Claude extension is active on the same origin. This is a known Chrome extension permission conflict. Workaround: use API-level testing via curl/bash for backend routes; use browser reads for UI audits.
- All CareerSwarm API routes use Supabase SSR cookie-based auth — they cannot be tested via curl with Bearer tokens. A real browser session is required to test the full UI flow.
- End-of-session: James says "end of session" -- update Current State + Learnings, then Cowork pushes CLAUDE.md directly via `git push origin main`.
- Git index.lock conflict: if `.git/index.lock` exists (from a Claude Code session), Cowork cannot stash or merge. Workaround: ask Claude Code to run `rm .git/index.lock && git pull origin main` at start of next session.
- Notion Mission Control: https://www.notion.so/325b12ea6b738114b859d4c11f82f9aa
